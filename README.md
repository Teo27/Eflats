# Eflats

This is an Eflat application based on the .Net framework.

In this project a server was made using C#. We had a lot of logic and a proper WCF, which had SOAP based services. All communications 
to the DB were made using stored procedures to provide extra protection. Transactions were used in several places, in order to improve
the performance of the software.

The website was made with the help of Bootstrap and is fully responsive. This was my first big website and it has bugs and it doesnt use
a master page, even though it is made with ASPs webforms.
